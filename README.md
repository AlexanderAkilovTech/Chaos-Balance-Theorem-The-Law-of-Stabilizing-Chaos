🌀 Chaos-Balance Theorem: The Law of Stabilizing Chaos

🚀 A fundamental mathematical theorem revealing that chaos naturally balances itself across multiple fields.

📊 This theorem connects chaos & stability in:
✔ Prime Numbers (Riemann Hypothesis 🔢)
✔ Chaotic Sequences (Collatz Conjecture 🔄)
✔ Fractals & Complexity (Mandelbrot Set 🌌)
✔ Entropy & Thermodynamics (2nd Law ♨️)
✔ Black Hole Physics & Universe Expansion (🌠)

🔍 Current Work:

✅ Developing Python simulations to validate the theorem
✅ Writing the formal mathematical proof in LaTeX
🔜 Exploring applications in cryptography, physics, and cosmology
📜 Mathematics, physics, and the fundamental laws of reality may be more structured than we ever imagined.

🚀 This repository documents the discovery, proof, and simulations of the Chaos-Balance Theorem.
