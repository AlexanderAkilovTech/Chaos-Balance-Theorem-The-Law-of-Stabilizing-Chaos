🚀 Chaos-Balance Theorem: The Law of Stabilizing Chaos

🔢 A groundbreaking mathematical theorem that reveals a hidden balance in chaotic systems.

🌀 This theorem stabilizes chaos in:
✔ Prime Numbers (Riemann Hypothesis)
✔ Chaotic Sequences (Collatz Conjecture)
✔ Fractals (Mandelbrot Set)
✔ Entropy & Thermodynamics
✔ Black Hole Physics & Universe Expansion

📜 Mathematics, physics, and the fundamental laws of nature may be more balanced than we ever realized.
